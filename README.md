## Git and Continuous Integration


**Steps that has been done in this submission**

* Made a new repository [Oblig3_Software_Engineering](https://github.com/stian96/Oblig3_Software_Engineering).

* Added testfiles from previous submission [pytest_test](https://github.com/stian96/Oblig3_Software_Engineering/tree/main/pytest_test).

* Implemented Github Actions so that the testfiles get executed everytime there is a commit/push to the repository.


### Steps in creating the workflow

* Created a new directory in the repository [.github/workflows](https://github.com/stian96/Oblig3_Software_Engineering/tree/main/.github/workflows).

* Then a new YALM file which contains the instructions for the workflow [action-tests.yml](https://github.com/stian96/Oblig3_Software_Engineering/blob/main/.github/workflows/action-tests.yml)
